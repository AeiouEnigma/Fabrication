	desc:
		Changes to vanilla balance.

balance.faster_obsidian:
	name: Faster Obsidian
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_and_client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/faster_obsidian.mp4
	desc:
		Makes obsidian and obsidian-related blocks break 3Ã— faster. Needed on both sides to work
		properly.
		
		Does not break vanilla clients when on the server, but when on the client, vanilla servers
		will think you're cheating. (And they won't be wrong.)

balance.disable_prior_work_penalty:
	name: Disable Prior Work Penalty
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only_with_client_helper
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/disable_prior_work_penalty.mp4
	desc:
		Disables the anvil prior work penalty when an item has been worked multiple times. Makes
		non-Mending tools relevant by allowing you to repair them indefinitely, and makes putting
		books on tools easier.
		
		If only on the server and not the client, the wrong level cost will briefly be displayed
		before being corrected.

balance.soul_speed_doesnt_damage_boots:
	name: Soul Speed Doesn't Damage Boots
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Makes running on soul blocks with Soul Speed not deal damage to your boots.

balance.infinity_mending:
	name: Infinity & Mending
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	default: burnt
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/infinity_mending.mp4
	desc:
		Makes Mending and Infinity compatible enchantments.

balance.hyperspeed_furnace_minecart:
	name: Hyperspeed Furnace Minecart
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/hyperspeed_furnace_minecart.mp4
	desc:
		Makes furnace minecarts very fast and burn fuel more quickly.
		
		An attempt to make rail transport relevant again, as well as furnace carts, in a world with
		ice roads, swimming, elytra, etc.
		
		Warning: These carts are so fast that they sometimes fall off of track corners. Make sure to
		surround track corners with blocks.

balance.tridents_accept_power:
	name: Tridents Accept Power
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/tridents_accept_power.mp4
	desc:
		Allows tridents to accept the Power enchantment, increasing their ranged damage. It's
		pitiful that tridents only deal as much damage as an unenchanted bow and this cannot be
		improved at all other than via Impaling, which is exclusive to aquatic mobs; notably,
		Drowned do not count as aquatic mobs. Only the harmless squids, salmon, cod, tropical fish,
		and the less harmless pufferfish and guardians count as "aquatic".
		
		Power is considered incompatible with Sharpness and Impaling.

balance.tridents_accept_sharpness:
	name: Tridents Accept Sharpness
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/tridents_accept_sharpness.mp4
	desc:
		Allows tridents to accept the Sharpness enchantment, increasing their melee damage. See
		above for justification. Tridents deal 1 more damage than a Netherite Sword, but this tweak
		*only* allows them to accept Sharpness; no Smite, no Looting, etc.
		
		Sharpness is considered incompatible with Power and Impaling.

balance.bedrock_impaling:
	name: Bedrock-Like Impaling
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/bedrock_impaling.mp4
	desc:
		Makes the Impaling enchantment act like it does in Bedrock Edition and Combat Test 4.
		Namely, it deals bonus damage to anything that is in water or rain (i.e. is wet), instead
		of only aquatic mobs.
		
		Interacts with Enhanced Moistness.

balance.environmentally_friendly_creepers:
	name: Environmentally Friendly Creepers

	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/environmentally_friendly_creepers.mp4

	fscript: player_entity
	default: burnt
	desc:
		Allows players to eat unconditionally.

balance.spawners_always_tick:
	name: Spawners Always Tick
	since: 1.3.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Spawners always count down their spawn timers, even if no player is nearby. This means a
		spawner that is left alone for a while will spawn *instantly* when a player comes in range.
		Allows shuttling a player between spawners with a minecart or water stream to efficiently
		make use of spawners that are close together, but not quite close enough to all be activated
		at the same time.

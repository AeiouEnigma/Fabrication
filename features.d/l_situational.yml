situational.all_damage_is_fatal:
	name: All Damage Is Fatal
	since: 1.0.1
	sides: server_only

	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/weapons_accept_silk.mp4
	desc:
		Weapons can be enchanted with Silk Touch, and Silk Touch becomes incompatible with Looting.

situational.player_free_spawners:
	name: Player Free Spawners
	since: 1.3.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Mob spawners don't require a player nearby to spawn. This can be dangerous on a normal world
		as it means all loaded spawners will constantly spawn mobs, which makes dungeons pre-loaded
		monsterboxes and floods abandoned mineshafts with cave spiders. Use carefully, preferably in
		worlds with structures disabled.
		
		See Balance > Spawners Always Tick for a less extreme, safer version of this.

situational.disable_elytra:
	name: Disable Elytra

	short_desc: Disables bee nest generation and all bee sounds
	desc:
		Prevents bee nests generating. Also disables all bee sounds.
		
		Useful if you have a bee phobia. Makes honey inaccessible; you may want a datapack to make
		it accessible again, and/or to make empty bee nests craftable for decor.

general
	name: General
	since: 1.0
	desc:
		Broad features and global settings.

general.profile
	name: Profile
	since: 1.0
	sides: unimportant
	desc:
		To help with Fabrication's overwhelming number of options, Profiles let you pick what kinds
		of features you want to be enabled by default. When a config value is set to 'unset', it is
		up to the profile whether it's enabled or disabled.
		
		The available profiles are:
		- Green: Enables nothing by default. Build your own.
		- Blonde: Fixes and utilities only. Keeps things vanilla-y.
		- Light: Blonde + tweaks. No major gameplay changes. Default.
		- Medium: Light + gameplay and mechanic additions. Recommended; gives you most of Fabrication's features.
		- Dark: Medium + major mechanic additions.
		- Vienna: Dark + balance tweaks, weird mechanic additions, and revivals of old features. Author's choice.
		- Burnt: Just enable everything, except the "Situational" section.

general.runtime_checks
	name: Runtime Checks
	since: 1.0
	sides: unimportant
	desc:
		Allows changing settings arbitrarily on-the-fly, but is very slightly slower and a fair bit
		less compatible, as all options that are set to 'unset' but not enabled by the profile will
		be initialized.
		
		You can still disable something completely if it's causing problems by setting it to false
		explicitly.
		
		With this disabled, most changes to config options will not take effect until the game is
		restarted.

general.reduced_motion
	name: Reduced Motion
	since: 1.2
	sides: client
	desc:
		Disables high-motion animations in the Fabrication config screen.

fixes
	name: Fixes
	since: 1.0
	desc:
		Fixes for bugs and weird behavior.

fixes.sync_attacker_yaw
	name: Sync Attacker Yaw
	since: 1.0
	sides: server client?
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/sync_attacker_yaw.mp4
	desc:
		Makes the last attacker yaw field sync properly when the player is damaged, instead of
		always being zero. Causes the camera shake animation when being hurt to tilt away from the
		source of damage instead of always tilting right.

		Fixes MC-26678, which is closed as Won't Fix.
		
		Needed on both client and server, but doesn't break vanilla clients.

fixes.furnace_minecart_pushing
	name: Furnace Minecart Pushing
	since: 1.0
	sides: server
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/furnace_minecart_pushing.mp4
	desc:
		Right-clicking a furnace minecart with a non-fuel while it's out of fuel gives it a little
		bit of fuel, allowing you to "push" it.

		Removed some time after 17w46a (1.13 pre releases); nobody seems to have noticed, and it
		wasn't announced.

fixes.use_player_list_name_in_tag
	name: Use Player List Name In Tag
	since: 1.0
	sides: client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/use_player_list_name_in_tag.png
	desc:
		Changes player name tags to match names in the player list. Good in combination with
		nickname mods like Drogtor.

fixes.better_pause_freezing
	name: Better Pause Freezing
	since: 1.0.1
	sides: client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/better_pause_freezing.mp4
	desc:
		Makes textures not tick while the game is paused.

fixes.inanimates_can_be_invisible
	name: Inanimates Can Be Invisible
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: client
	desc:
		Makes inanimate entities honor the "invisible" tag sent by the server. Does nothing on its
		own; the server must have something that marks inanimate entities as invisible, such as
		Fabrication's own Invisibility Splash On Inanimates.

fixes.omniscent_player
	name: Inanimates Can Be Invisible
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/omniscent_player.mp4
	desc:
		The player render in the inventory follows your cursor, even if it's not inside the game
		window.

fixes.uncap_menu_fps
	name: Uncap Menu FPS
	since: 1.2
	sides: client
	desc:
		Removes the hardcoded 60 FPS cap in menu screens, instead using whatever you have the
		framerate cap set to.
		
		Primarily added because in prior versions the cap was 30 FPS and I thought it still was.
		Maybe this is nice if you have a 144Hz display?
